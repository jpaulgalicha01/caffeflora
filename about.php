            <h1>Creative Vegetarian Cuisine</h1><br>
            <p>Since opening its doors, Cafe Flora has been at the forefront of utilizing local, organic and sustainable produce and building strong, direct relationships with Washington farms. Its culinary team draws inspiration from international traditions and the availability of abundant, locally grown produce to create imaginative and dynamic vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free cuisine.</p><br>
            <p>Cafe Flora has also carried its eco-conscious philosophy into its sibling restaurants, Floret and the Flora Bakehouse. Floret opened in 2018 and has served as a beacon in the SeaTac airport, offering scratch made, seasonal vegetarian cuisine in a place with nothing else like it. A charming and refreshing respite in the bustling airport, Floret offers travelers a chance to take a breath whether they have 3 minutes or 30.</p><br>
            <p>The newest addition to the Flora family, Flora Bakehouse, is now open! Offering a cozy cafe space where freshly baked pastries and bread can be enjoyed alongside a delicious cup of coffee.</p><br>
            <p>The winning combination of eco-friendly philosophy, community based involvement, and cutting-edge, dynamic vegetarian cuisine has brought about tremendous support for all three locations. Come by and enjoy a bite!</p><br>

                <small>Food has always had a powerful connection: breaking bread together builds powerful bonds. We are a community, both within our restaurants and bakery, our neighborhoods, and beyond.
